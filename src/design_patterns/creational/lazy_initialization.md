# Lazy Initialization

Lazy initialization is a design pattern that defers the creation of an object until it is first used. It is a type of creational pattern that is used to improve performance and resource utilization. The lazy initialization pattern is useful when the cost of object creation is high and the object is not always required.

Lazy initialization can be implemented in various ways, such as using a private constructor, a static method, or a closure to create the object when it is first accessed. This pattern ensures that the object is created only when it is needed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.

## Example Implementation in Rust
