# Interpreter

The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a grammar for interpreting a language and provides an interpreter to parse the grammar. It is used to define a language grammar and provide a way to interpret sentences in that language.

The Interpreter pattern is particularly useful when you need to interpret a language or define a grammar for a domain-specific language. It allows you to define a language grammar and provide an interpreter to parse and interpret sentences in that language.
