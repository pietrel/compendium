# Design Patterns

Design patterns are standard approaches to solving frequent issues in software design. They act as ready-made templates that you can adapt to address specific recurring challenges in your programming projects.

## Creational

Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms. They help in creating objects in a manner suitable for the situation. The creational design patterns are:

- [Abstract Factory](creational/abstract_factory.md)
- [Builder](creational/builder.md)
- [Factory Method](creational/factory_method.md)
- [Singleton](creational/singleton.md)
- [Multiton](creational/multiton.md)
- [Lazy Initialization](creational/lazy_initialization.md)
- [Object Pool](creational/object_pool.md)
- [Prototype](creational/prototype.md)

## Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects. They help in defining how objects interact with each other and how they operate. The behavioral design patterns are:

- [Strategy](behavioral/strategy.md)

## Structural

Structural design patterns deal with object composition. They help in defining relationships between objects and how they can be assembled to form larger structures. The structural design patterns are:
