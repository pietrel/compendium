# Sorting

The organization of an array, or the way its elements are arranged before sorting, can significantly impact the performance and behavior of sorting algorithms. The initial order of elements — whether they are already sorted, randomly distributed, or sorted in reverse — can make a considerable difference in how quickly and efficiently the sorting process completes. Here are some key ways the organization of an array influences different sorting algorithms:

- **Already Sorted Arrays**
```rust
let mut already_sorted_numbers = [11, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90];
```
- **Reverse Sorted Arrays**
```rust
let mut reverse_sorted_numbers = [90, 64, 34, 25, 22, 11];
```
- **Randomly Distributed Arrays**
```rust
let mut randomly_distributed_numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
```
- **Nearly Sorted Arrays**
```rust
let mut nearly_sorted_numbers = [11, 25, 22, 34, 64, 90];
```
- **Few Unique Elements**
```rust
let mut few_unique_numbers = [34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34];
```
