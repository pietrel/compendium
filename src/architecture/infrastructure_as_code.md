# Infrasructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (processes, servers, networks, etc.) using machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The code can be in a version control system. It is a type of IT infrastructure that operations teams can automatically manage and provision through code, rather than using a manual process.

IaC allows you to automate the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure, which can help reduce errors, increase efficiency, and improve consistency. It also allows you to treat your infrastructure as code, which means you can apply the same software development practices to your infrastructure that you use for your applications.
